#Abstract: 
In this assignment I was following the tutorial on the different regression algorithms. I used three different algorithms such as ADA, DT and lightGBM and compared their efficiency on the white wine data set. After the finilizing the model and testing it on the data set itself using the "R2" metric to check I got the results of the predictions. According to the test scores using the "R2" metric I came to the conclusion that lightGBM performs better than ADA or DT algorithms.
